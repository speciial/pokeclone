# POKECLONE

Pokeclone is a small project where I implement a Pokemon (specifically the FireRed/LeafGreen versions) clone in C. This project will make use of a couple libraries to create windows and set up a rendering context for OpenGL. Other than that though, there won't be many dependencies since this project is meant as a programming exercise. 

## Building and Running the Program

To keep things simple, this project will only target Windows and use the MSVC compiler. To build the application, simply run the build.bat script in a terminal with the MSVC developer tools enabled (x64 Native Command Tools). This will generate a build folder where the executable (application.exe) can be found.
